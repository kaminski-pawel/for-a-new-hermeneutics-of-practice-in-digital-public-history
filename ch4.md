# Chapter 4: The historian’s kitchen, or how to cook your memories?


> We need projects that will involve people in exploring what it means to remember, and what to do with memories to make them active and alive, as opposed to mere objects of collection. To the extent this is done, we will be seizing an opportunity not nearly so accessible to conventional academic historical scholarship, whatever its virtues: the opportunity to help liberate for that active remembering all the intelligence, in the way I am using it, of a people long kept separated from the sense of their own past.
> - Michael Frisch, The Memory of History, 1981.


_Shaping a digital memory platform on migration narratives_ was a bold plan for an experimental case study. The collaborative process of shaping the Memorecord platform, as described in [Chapter 2](./ch2), was full of insights and setbacks, which resulted in many practical lessons, but also required constant negotiation with the original plan. The participatory design of the project and the technical aspects involved required time and flexibility to learn new skills and collaborate with experts when my competencies were limited. The topic of migration added another layer of complexity to the practical side of the project, reaching participants to share memories of their migration trajectory publicly was challenging, especially considering how the topic can arise sensitive questions. In this chapter I examine more closely how the subject of migration and its eminence in the Grand-Duchy's society, in addition to the methodological issues identified by now, have played a strong part in the shaping of the project and may have contributed to the scale and quality of collection obtained in a different way than I was expecting, perhaps ingenuously.
