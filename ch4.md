# Chapter 4: The historian’s kitchen, or how to cook your memories?


> We need projects that will involve people in exploring what it means to remember, and what to do with memories to make them active and alive, as opposed to mere objects of collection. To the extent this is done, we will be seizing an opportunity not nearly so accessible to conventional academic historical scholarship, whatever its virtues: the opportunity to help liberate for that active remembering all the intelligence, in the way I am using it, of a people long kept separated from the sense of their own past.
> - Michael Frisch, The Memory of History, 1981.


_Shaping a digital memory platform on migration narratives_ was a bold plan for an experimental case study. The collaborative process of shaping the Memorecord platform, as described in [Chapter 2](./ch2), was full of insights and setbacks, which resulted in many practical lessons, but also required constant negotiation with the original plan. The participatory design of the project and the technical aspects involved required time and flexibility to learn new skills and collaborate with experts when my competencies were limited. The topic of migration added another layer of complexity to the practical side of the project, reaching participants to share memories of their migration trajectory publicly was challenging, especially considering how the topic can arise sensitive questions. In this chapter I examine more closely how the subject of migration and its eminence in the Grand-Duchy's society, in addition to the methodological issues identified by now, have played a strong part in the shaping of the project and may have contributed to the scale and quality of collection obtained in a different way than I was expecting, perhaps ingenuously.

## Analysing the harvested memories: the Memorecord’s cooking

<!-- TODO: add missing content -->

### Tira-gostos

In my birth country, but more specifically in my family, we never use the polite forms to refer to _appetizers,_ in Brazilian Portuguese _antepasto_ or _entrada_. We rather refer to it as tira-gosto, which is the most colloquial, popular way to call it. You do not find _tira-gosto_ written on the menu of chic restaurants, but in _botecos,_ the simplest street bars. The noun _boteco_ is itself a derivation of _botequim_, a corruption of the word “botica” coming to Brazil, in its turn, from the Portuguese of Portugal. _Botica_, however, derives from the Greek _apothéke_, which means "storehouse", “warehouse”. When Rio de Janeiro was hosting the Portuguese Court (1808-1821), when it became the capital of the Portuguese Kingdom, _boticas_ began to flourish in the city. It is estimated that 15.000 people have been transferred from Lisbon with the Braganza Royal Family to Rio. The _boticas_ remain scattered in the center of the old Rio and even nowadays, some of the _antique_ Portuguese storehouses, or _armazéns_, became _botecos_ for us in Rio (i.e. the current _tascas_ in Portugal). The best ones, they say (and I agree), are those at the crossroads. Apart from being one of the most traditional meeting places in Rio, where people from “all corners of the world” meet, nowadays _botecos_ are also part of a resistance to the gentrification of the city that has been intensified by big international events like the World Cup (2014) and the Olympic Games (2016). For these reasons, instead of talking about _appetizers,_ I will talk about _tira-gostos_ because the _boteco_ grammar seems to better incorporate the forcible synthesis of this chapter[^ref-192]. The _tira-gosto_, imported from botecos to family and friend’s reunions, is nothing like a full course, but unlike chic restaurant’s appetizers, it is a popular delicacy that will not let you starve. Finally, a good _tira-gosto_ is also known to whet your appetite, to “abrir os trabalhos” we say (as in kick off). In this sense, my conclusion from the exploration of the crowdsourced memories is rather an invitation to continue researching, than a conclusive analysis.

I believe the bigger challenge in making sense of these memories was related to grasping their context. For this, it was necessary to keep digging and making assumptions. I tried to do so, by crossing referencing participants' posts among each other and putting it in perspective with a bigger context, informed by other sources and literature on the history of immigration in Luxembourg. Nevertheless, this further exploration was limited to the scope and time attributed to this study case. If I was to build up a contextualisation purely based on social media, the exploration could go on indeterminately. Excluding the possibility of circulating an electronic form with standard questions to all the participants, for instance, if, hypothetically, I was set out to define birth place, date of birth and migration path (i.e. information that was easier to obtain from the interviewees in _Racontez Votre Histoire_) of all the participants only by means of digital ethnography, I do not know how long it would take, how systematic and accurate it could be. Perhaps, instead of  scanning the person’s profile, it would be easier, in this case, to send a direct message and start a one-to-one conversation (chat) in private – yet another form of interview? In any case, such a study would have a different grade of proximity and would bring up other ethical issues in terms of respecting the privacy of participants and accessing/exchanging private data on a commercial digital platform. At the end, this would require another submission to the Ethical Review Panel and, ultimately, would configure another case study.

Implicated in the problem of contextualisation, the main digital interference brought by the digital-born material in this study case is the fact that, at least for content scraped from the social media used here (Facebook and Instagram), the metadata cannot be taken for granted. One can only make assumptions, to be confirmed or not, by further exploration and crossing of information from other sources – or perhaps within the source itself (i.e. comment section) – to check whether they corroborate or contradict the data. In other words, the metadata and the content of posts from social media _alone_ do not enable conditions for source criticism. We might always remember, however, that even in respect to the analogue format, it is virtually impossible to implement source criticism from isolated sources.

However, in contrast to what happens working on analogue sources, the close reading and confrontation of sources, might be, to the limit, never enough to confirm some basic information. For instance, considering the work with diaries, determining the author could also be a task informed by the analysis of the handwriting, for instance, while to ascertain the date it was created, chemical analysis could come in handy, helping to define the age of the diary paper. When we move to the digital realms, all these established techniques of document examination seem to be helpless. One might consider, as phrased by {cite}`kirschenbaum_digital_2010{et al.}`, “a digital forensics”. Digital forensics, nevertheless, is based on knowledge accumulated from forensic sciences which dates to the end of the 19th Century, coincidently, the same period to which we refer to the canons of historicism. “As probative evidence – they write – data are clearly vulnerable to being tampered with and manipulated”, moreover, “digital evidence is almost always partial or incomplete.” [@kirschenbaum_digital_2010, 06]. Those are very challenging characteristics for crime investigators, especially considering cybernetic crimes that involve hacking, cracking and scouring around computers like detectives looking at thousand objects in a crime scene.

To what concerns Memorecord, no crime suspect needs to be hacked, no one's life is at risk, so the pressure is rather soft on the digital historian. However, the value of digital methods and the work on digital-born material is at stake. With so many doubts on the table, why care about using digital methods instead of traditional? To the limits of this project, as aforementioned, the added value is in the heuristics of experimentation itself, looking into the future of digital history scholarship. The interferences I encountered in this experiment will, in no time, become the rule and not the exception for anyone studying contemporary history. I believe, therefore, that it is reasonable enough for us to argue that studying it today, despite the open questions, is a necessity [@fickers_update_2020].

In my attempt to produce some explanation based on the crowdsourced memories, I confronted myself with limitations that, I am convinced, cannot be eliminated, but could be mitigated by the combination of old and new forms of criticism. On social media, for example, while we can determine the _user_ who posted the content, usernames do not always mirror the person’s real name. In addition, it is not always possible to determine the post location, for instance. Knowing those posts were created in the context of Memorecord we can arguably assume that posts were created somewhere in Luxembourg or by someone who lives in Luxembourg. But on the other hand, posts tagged in Lisbon, for instance, can contradict this assumption while still opening another question: the post with the picture of a happy couple in Lisbon was really posted from there or was it posted a posteriori using a picture taken sometime before? Hence, location and timestamps of the posts cannot really be trusted.

When it comes to identifying the nature of the source, the metadata is objective, whereas it is a video, a picture, a URL. Yet, this information is only true to a certain extent, because there is another (meta)level which may be not so explicit due to the mediated nature of the sources. For instance, the video from the EVS volunteer (preview in Figure 34), I can only tell it is about 2010, but I would not know whether it was edited in December that year, or if it was edited sometime later. I could only assume it was an old video that was not recorded to Memorecord itself, but it would be difficult to be precisely know who did the recordings and exactly when. At the same time, even for digital photos that seemed to have been posted for Memorecord, this specific information can only be guessed, because the metadata attached to the pictures, for instance, reveals the day when they were posted on Facebook and not really the exact day they were actually taken by the participant. If I was an investigator, with access to the suspect’s smartphone, perhaps, this verification would be made easier.

The motivation of a post, on the other hand, may not be that difficult to identify since the people who participated took part in the project intentionally. However, since the posts contents came up on social media and not in an interview setting, it was not possible to ask, directly, why some people have decided to share the specific contents they shared. It would have been useful, for instance, to re-involve participants in the process of interpreting the posts. How different would the community coding have been from what I did? I wish I would have had the time to do it differently.

Apparently, what happens is that we are left with the task to contextualise these sources within and outside the collection as the only way to make sense of it, although always in terms of speculations. Going back to the comparison of the word clouds then, I try to identify, instead of what is common, what is different from what we found in the interview sample. We, for instance, see that _art_, _music_ and _leisure_ is present in the cloud originated from Memorecord crowdsourcing, but absent in the interviews cloud. What could explain this? For music, I have a good guess: during the crowdsourcing, I published some “activation posts” which were contents edited and posted by myself in order to encourage people to participation. In the month of June 2018, for instance, on the occasion of the International Music Day (21st June), I published a video inviting people to share songs that were dear to them and somehow related to their migratory background. See _Video 10:_

#memorecord #nowplaying Saudade | Activation post on #music & #migration by Anita Lucchesi
:::

As a result, a few posts were shared and, to my surprise, not all the song’s lyrics were related to the topic of migration, but participants associate the memory of listening to songs which somehow connect their past experiences to their journey to Luxembourg or other migration paths. In the post below ([](#fig-55)), for instance, the media added is the preview of a song on YouTube by the Cuban singer Celia Cruz and American musician Tito Puente, Quimbara (1974), a salsa. The author of the post is an Italian, but I can only tell that because I have met her previously. She shares that this song reminds her of a discovery of a new part of her, 32 years ago, in a Latin concert, in London. It would be difficult to understand the link of this post with her migratory background if I did not know, beforehand, that she had a relationship with a Cuban and that her passion for travelling – hence London, hence Cuba – could only blossom after she had moved to Luxembourg. Travelling, indeed, is an “advantage” of Luxembourg, many people say, due to its centrality in the “heart of Europe”. However, travelling for touristic reasons (not only going back to visit family in Portugal or Italy), as well as other leisure activities or volunteering/community work, is something very recent in the life of Luxembourg migrants. This is very connected to the existence of new socio-economic profiles, the resources to travel or to engage actively in community organisations – time and money – were not so available to the common immigrant 50, 60 years ago.

What this kind of post suggests, in light of the historical context, is that we may have a stratification of immigrant profiles that we did not have before. And this is, indeed, a fact, as I tried to demonstrate in the previous sections with the historical retrospective and some demographic data. However, these posts on leisure, art and music do not give much clue about the dynamics between these new profiles of migrants, who are they, how do they relate to each other? This, for instance, would be a great topic for further investigations. In this regard, what I could notice during the promotion of the Memorecord crowdsourcing is that the project was never really welcomed among the so-called _expat_ community. I tried, four or five times, to post on Facebook expat groups about the project inviting people to share their memories about migrations. My posts were never even accepted by the group's managers. Talking with a potential participant about it, a person who has worked at European Institutions in the past, told me that “they don’t like to identify themselves as immigrants”. While some posts in the collection may suggests a variety of socio-economic background, the lack of engagement, or the rejections of the expat groups in sharing the news about Memorecord could suggest a strong class bias in the collection and, at the same time, that there is a classist isolation in the Luxembourgish society whose origins could be further explored. In my guessing work, since the collection does not tell much more, what I can raise as a hypothesis is the fact that some of the more qualified and rich non-national residents in Luxembourg try to avoid links with other immigrants. However, in the end, this is all speculation. It could be the case that my posts were simply overlooked by the expat group managers or that even if it had been approved we would not have received participation from them for other subjective reasons. Again, an open question.

Another activation post example was an invitation I posted asking people to share their first picture in Luxembourg. The idea was to organise an actual workshop of portraits after that asking people to bring old photos and make a new portrait. I would have had the help of a photographer who is himself an immigrant. Due to health problems, unfortunately, I missed the timing to realise the workshop. Nevertheless, the invitation to share old pictures on Instagram mobilised a few people. One example is this digitisation of an analogue photograph hereunder ([](#fig-56)):

_- It may not be the first photo, but it is the oldest one I have in Luxembourg. With my Pre-Primary class, I should have been 5 years old (back in 1978). The photo was taken in the park next to the Neiwiss Primary School in Rodange (at the time it was the "École des Garçons"). I'm still in contact with some of the people in the photo. I still remember the bombazine pants and even the white pullover._

_This picture for me is not located in Luxembourg, it is kind of strange, but it is located in a world that no longer exists called the past._

_It may seem like a commonplace to say it this way, but for me it's something that I feel almost physically. When I go to the location of the photo, it is as if I am unable to be in the right place, as if that place existed only in another dimension. It is strange and familiar at the same time. "_
