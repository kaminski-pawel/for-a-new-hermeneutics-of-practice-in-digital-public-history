# Chapter 3: Analysing Digital Methods – A Return to Hermeneutics

At the beginning of our century, the French Historian François Hartog published a seminal work to reflect on the conditions of producing history in the current time in his _Regimes d’Historicité_ (2003), Hartog points out a profound alteration in the way contemporary society perceives the passage of time. Since Hartog's publication, several studies have claimed that the electronic culture, increasingly ubiquitous, is  accountable for the potentisation of the accelerated experience of time that characterises today's presentism. To Hartog, acceleration is only one of the symptoms of this specific regime of historicity, the increasing attention to historical heritage and related public policies, as well the growing fascination towards the past in the mainstream media are equally meaningful markers of this temporal experience. The transition from the print to the digital age seems to be the momentous shift in which Hartog’s reflections are circumscribed. As early as 2004, Italian historian Dario Ragazzini wrote:

> It follows that daily activity - high or low, exceptional or ordinary - leaves information traces, which will be the documents and sources of the future history of our present. As the historiography of an alphabetical culture is different from that of an oral culture, so the historiography of a digital culture will – and already is – different from that of a literal culture. (Ragazzini 2004, vii, translated from Italian by myself)

As Ragazzini argues, the culture of our time is different and so will be the historical craft. Digital technology – as it has been greatly demonstrated in the advancing realms of digital and public history – enables a vast range of possibilities to interrogate and (re)present the past to our peers and publics. While up to now, new forms of delivering historical knowledge in digital formats have been prominent in digital history and public history research, so far there have been few empirical investigations into the methodological and interpretative dimensions of historical research in the digital age. *In this chapter, I discuss, based on insights from the Memorecord case study, how _the digital component_ (Berry 2011, 12) is conditioning historical research in its full capacity.*
