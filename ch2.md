# Chapter 2:  Shaping the Memorecord Digital Memory Platform

## Documenting the process

Sometimes the process is more important than the result, as once noted by the performative artist Marina Abramović. She eloquently recollects the deep impact of her first painting lesson here:  

> He \[artist Filo Filipović] cut out a piece of canvas and put it on the floor. He opened a can of glue and threw the liquid on the canvas; he added a little bit of sand, some yellow pigment, some red pigment, and some black. Then he poured about half a litre of gasoline on it, lit a match, and everything exploded. "This is a sunset," he told me. And then he left. (...) I waited until the charred mess had dried, and then very carefully pinned it to the wall. Then my family and I left for vacation. When I came back, the August sun had dried everything up. The color was gone and the sand had fallen off. There was nothing left but a pile of ashes and sand on the floor. The sunset didn't exist anymore.
> - @abramovic_walk_2016, p. 27 [^ref-16]

The details of Filipović’s creative _process_ depicted by the Serbian artist in her memoirs could not be seen in the final art. After a while, most of the artistic process had vanished, leaving behind nothing but a few traces. In this scenario, used materials and techniques could become irretrievable even to trained eyes. The same often happens to many digital scholarship projects; we get to experience their final products, but rarely learn from their manufacturing process.

In this chapter, I will focus on the process of building the case study of this thesis. This experimental study is the base of our theoretical reflections on the new conditions of historical research in the 21st Century. Given the ever-evolving digital technologies, and thus the evolution of digital practices, this chapter is dedicated to documenting the process of building Memorecord, instead of merely presenting its final outcome. The aim of this chapter is thus to enable readers to do an in-depth evaluation of this exercise of digital scholarship by offering a thorough description of Memorecord's collaborative building process. I will give details about the workflow, decision-making processes, problems, solutions, and insights encountered along the project timeline. The development of Memorecord platform from scratch to the screen was a genuinely hands-on historiographical experiment. This experimentation helped to test the heuristic value of digital and public history approaches for academic purposes, which will be discussed from a more theoretical point a view in the following chapter.

The ultimate goal of this chapter is to offer insights on the process, allowing the retrieval (and appraisal) of the technical resources we have used and, equally as important, making the reasoning behind the choices I have made explicit. Such reflexivity is part of a "doing as thinking" [@drucker_humanistic_2012, p. 87] process that marked this empirical exercise. It helps to inform other scholars that may be interested in doing a similar experiment or in assessing the project in its integrity[^ref-17]. This chapter can be considered a snapshot of our digital _repertoire_ for the time we conducted this research (2015-2020), a recollection of gestures and choices as crucial as the Memorecord outcome itself for its further analysis. I hope that this chapter encourages other "digital history brokers" [@kemman_trading_2019, p. 30] to do the same, as a contribution to the discipline of history documenting itself in the digital age.

### The case study

Selecting memories of migration in Luxembourg as the main subject for the case study was strategic. Public history was a key component of the research project. Working on a topic of high relevance to the Grand Duchy society was a must. The subject of migration, furthermore, could create a public debate in the best interest of the migrant population. Public history, in this project, was not limited to the amplification of audiences. In the very making of the digital scholarship experiment, this approach was not only meant to reach out to other audiences, it was also meant to engage with them in a meaningful way [@mills_making_2013]. The primary aim of the case study was to investigate Italian and Portuguese migrants in Luxembourg, more specifically their memories about their migration experience. I wanted to compare how these migrants remembered different aspects of their migration trajectory in the country – their arrival, processes of adaptation, day-to-day challenges, recurring feelings about their home country and Luxembourg. It would enable an analysis of concurrent migration narratives. I was interested in verifying whether the way each national group recounts their stories complies with what the national master narrative says about migration in the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg[^ref-18][@seifert_canada_2008]. The Italians appeared first in the demographic movements' timeline. The early flow of migrant arrivals dates back to the late 19th Century, many coming to Luxembourg to work, mainly in the mining industry. The Portuguese were the latest major foreign national group to arrive, many years later, after the country had suffered significant transformations in its social, economic and cultural fabric. Almost a century apart, when the Portuguese arrived, the once thriving mining industry had lost its prominence but remained acutely alive in people's minds. When the first Portuguese arrived (1960 - 1970), Luxembourg was beginning to take its first steps on the path of becoming the notable financial sphere it represents in today's Europe. However, the glow of the banking business has never overshadowed the symbolic capital of the mining enterprise in Luxembourg. The Grand Duchy was, and remains, the country of the Terre Rouges,_ or _De Minett_, as the southern iron-red soil is called.

In contemporary Luxembourg, more than 170 nationalities are living together in a _harmonious_ way, as echoed in many official texts that corroborate the statement of Luxembourg "as an immigration success story" [@fetzer_luxembourg_2011]. Based on previous research, as I began designing the case study for the present doctoral dissertation, I took a rather sceptical stance towards this predominantly positive discourse about migration in the country [@reuter_retour_2007]. This case study investigates this overall positiveness and tries to explain how Italian and Portuguese migrants perceive this. The study may also help to understand the extent to which the migrants themselves contribute to the national rhetoric [@guimaraes_historiografia_2011]. To do so, a mixed-method study [@creswell_research_2009] was set-up. In addition to an established qualitative approach (i.e. ethnography, oral history), digital public history methods were explored as a way to engage the migrants in the making of the project and gain insights from alternative data sources on migration. Beyond literature review, statistical data (i.e. national population and housing surveys) and administrative records (i.e. registers, border data collection systems, visas, residence and/or work permits) all informed the preparation of the fieldwork. Quantitative data also supported the analysis of the personal accounts collected, assisting in the critiques of the qualitative resources.  The digital public history component of the study consisted of shaping a digital platform for harvesting memories through a crowdsourcing experiment. I was interested to know if using alternative methods of research to add new voices to the story of migration in Luxembourg would bring new findings to the table. 

With this in mind, what were the expectations regarding this digital memory platform? To begin with, creating a space for real engagement and starting a conversation focusing not only on the project's outcome – the memory harvest – but in the participatory design of it, making the migrant's participation essential to the conception of the platform itself. The notion of shared authority [@frisch_shared_1990] strongly marked the formulation of the project from the beginning. The experiment was planned to be an ongoing conversation with the project's participants, working closely with them to allow continuous interactivity among us. The perspective of history from below [@thompson_history_1966] underlined my concerns on the social function of history and the call for civic engagement, so grasping the community spirit was vital in this sense. I imagined that collecting mediated memories [@dijck_mediated_2007] through a crowdsourcing experiment could be a way to bridge individual and collective memories and help me to see the contributions through a more popular lens, from a grass-roots perspective. At the same time, working on mediated memories broadened the analytical scope of the study by adding the digital component, so pivotal to the technical development of the platform, and acted as a forging element of the collection. The collaborative process of shaping this platform should allow researchers and communities to grasp the migration landscape from its multi-perspective, mirrored in this mosaic-like platform whose pieces are individual expressions from the collective, integrating diversity and inserting the once peripheral memories into the bigger picture [@frisch_oral_2019].

The infographic below [_Figure 1_](#fig-1) gives an overview of the milestones experienced up to the final product for the Memorecord memory harvest. In the following sections, I will present each of the developing phases indicated hereunder. I will also report on the adaptations that became necessary to guarantee pursuit of the project's original goals while trying to accommodate the different expectations and contributions of the community participants.

## Fieldwork

The fieldwork for the case study consisted in **exploratory archival research** and **ongoing ethnographic observation** that I carried throughout all the phases of the project. The first observations started informally with my situation as a newcomer, recently arrived from Brazil at the beginning of the PhD studies, in 2015. The sonic landscape has left a massive impression on me from the first time I commuted by train from Luxembourg City to Esch-sur-Alzette. The babble of languages and accents that one could hear on public transport around the country was remarkable. Later on, the noteworthy multilingualism would prove to be one of the many practical challenges to the project.

After preliminary inquiries at the National Archives and at the _Centre de Documentation sur les Migrations Humaines (CDMH)_ in Dudelange, I readily understood that the CDMH was not only a mere source for documents. Over the years it has grown far beyond its intention as a place for _rencontre_ and cultural exchange; now it has collected an extensive list of cultural activities and has become the home for a specialized library on migration. Thus, we decided to follow their initiatives more closely and explore its surroundings, the neighbourhood of _Petite Italie_. The vicinity’s toponymy reconnects Dudelange, the train station and the CDMH itself to the migration history in Luxembourg. Around its location, we could see a landscape of old buildings coloured by the smoke of the ancient blast furnaces, the rails of the trains, and in the distance, on the other side of the rails, some pavilions that remained from the busy working town it used to be.

[^ref-16]: As I began describing the process of building this case study, I want to thank the many people that, beyond my supervisors, contributed fundamentally to the results I will present along this chapter. My most sincere acknowledgments to Daniele Guido, Emmanuele Hingray and Lars Wieneke for all the work and inputs in the building of the Memorecord crowdsourcing mechanism and website. To Andy O’dwyer, head of the DH Lab, there will be not enough thanks for his support in all fronts - logistics, technological, intellectual. I also thank Mariana Menezes (student assistant) for her competent work helping me in the preparation for the launch of Memorecord. To my PhD colleagues, for their helping reviewing the translations and testing the website: Max Kemman, Fabio Spirinelli, Richard Legay and Dominique Santana, *merci*! Also, to Fabio and Dominique, "*muito obrigadas*" for the many occasions in which they drove me around or used their car to transport iPads supporters, paper boxes, posters and other utilities. I also want to thank everybody who helped me in the promotion of the project (e.g. distribution of flyers and posters, sharing Memorecord posts on their social network profiles), specially Barbara Correa de Mello Menezes, Heidi Martins, Luisa Martins, Anne Carolina Ramos and Gregório Entringer. To Heidi, big thanks too for sharing her talented crafts in the customization of the Memorecord feedback box (which accompanied me in the many events I visited for the project) and her support with the launch event. To Marinella Rinaldis and Nicolas Graf, many thanks for their time working in the postal and digital distribution of Memorecord's flyers to the mailing list of the *Centre de Documentations sur les Migrations Humanies* (CDMH). To everybody else in the *Centre Doc* - Marcel Lorenzini, Maria Luisa Caldognetto, Dario Cieol, Denis Scutto, Jos Till, Antoinette Reuter and Narcisse Dovenon - my special thanks for their long term collaboration, for hearing me, introducing me to people, lending me books and  supporting me over the years, in the realisation of *Racontez Votre Histoire de Vie* and in all the editions of the *Festival des Migrations* we went together. To Sarah Cooper, from the University Language Centre, my special thanks for her assistance with proofreading the website, poster and flyers content. _Villmools Merci_ to Isabel Voegeli and Noëlle Schon for their steady assistance along the project preparation and diffusion.

[^ref-17]: A straightforward guide with all the steps to reproduce this experiment is provided in the online version of the thesis – Cf. "Memorecord Cookbook" on [http://pupmemo.uni.lu/](http://pupmemo.uni.lu/).

[^ref-18]: The immigration and emigration history component will be further discussed in Chapter [3](#) and [4](#). In the current chapter, migration and demographic facts are only stressed to the extent they help to understand why the selected subject was relevant to this research project and its importance in the country. A deeper reflection on the historiography of migration and on the analysis of the collected data in the crowdsourcing experiment will be provided after we describe the building of the case study in which, precisely, migration is at stake.
